This repository contains my solutions to the [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com) challenges.

for making AdventOfCode challenges by [@UnderKoen](https://github.com/UnderKoen)

<!-- I am currently in the middle of adding new solutions every day, to compare with afterwards. -->

## :thinking: FAQ

### :christmas_tree: What is AdventOfCode?
[Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about) 
People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

Challenges are released each day from the 1st to 25th of December.

### :snowflake: Where can I find your solutions? 
My solutions can be found in [this package](src/main/java/nl/daandvl/adventofcode/solutions/)

### :sled: These solutions look rushed. Why is that?
It's because they are. I play AdventOfCode [competitively](https://adventofcode.com/2021/leaderboard) with my friends each year.
The faster you are done completing a challenge, the more points you get.
